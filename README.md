# Helmet-Detection-Recognition

We will learn how to:
1. Install Tensorflow Object Detection on a Local Machine and on Colab
2. Collect and Label images for Object Detection using LabelImg
3. Train Deep Learning powered Object Detection Models using Python and TFOD
4. Detect objects in real time using a webcam and using Images
5. Tune Object Detection models to improve Precision and Recall
6. Export your model to Tensorflow JS for integration in React JS web apps
7. Export your model to TFLite for use on a Raspberry Pi
